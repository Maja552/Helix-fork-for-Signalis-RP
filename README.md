Fork of helix for the Signalis RP in Garry's Mod.
If you want to locally use it, go into your addons folder inside Steam\steamapps\common\GarrysMod\garrysmod\addons, make a folder called something like helix_addon, make a folder called gamemodes inside of it, and then unzip the downloaded zip inside of it.
